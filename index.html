				<div class="p">
					Today we elect congressmen and women every few
					years.  These people alone may change what laws
					are in place.  Our representative democracy was
					designed long ago by wise people.  Unfortunately,
					they did not have the Internet back then.</div>
				<div class="p">
					Like all politicians, we promise change.  However,
					we do not promise to change this law or that law -
					we decidedly do not have stances on most political
					issues.  Instead, we promise to change the way
					laws get made.</div>
				<div class="p">
					We will host an online database of the statutes
					currently in effect.  If you are a registered
					voter, you will have the following abilities:</div>
				<div class="p">
					<ul>
						<li>assign someone as your congressperson, giving
							them your vote</li>
						<li>directly vote on bills</li>
						<li>change any laws, and submit your bill for
							approval</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="p">
					As soon as any submitted change gets votes from
					2/3 of the registered population, it is
					immediately signed into law.  We will soon begin
					to build a rough draft of that website right here.</div>
				<div class="p">
					After election, we will initialize the website so
					that current members of congress carry the votes
					of their constituents.  Then you can all log in
					and do whatever you want.
				</div>
				<div class="p">
					The website itself is open source at https://github.com/jeffersoncarpenter/thelawsinwisconsin
