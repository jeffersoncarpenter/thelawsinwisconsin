The Laws in Wisconsin

We're running for Governer of Wisconsin.  We will show up as "You" on
the ballot, because that's what we are.

Today we elect congressmen and women every few years.  These people
have the exclusive ability to change what laws are in place.  This
system was designed by wise people long ago.  Unfortunately, the
Internet wasn't around back then.

Coarse grained control over the laws is not enough.  Few people agree
exactly what we should do, but most agree that Congress isn't doing
it.

If we are elected Governor, we will host an online database of the
statutes currently in effect.  If you are a registered voter, you will
have the following abilities:

* assign someone as your congressperson, giving them your vote

* directly vote on bills

* change any laws, and submit your bill for approval

As soon as any submitted change gets votes from 2/3 of the
registered population, it is immediately signed into law.

It'll be a smooth ride from a representative democracy to a direct
democracy.  Our website will be initialized with all currently
registered voters, and their assigned congresspeople will be their
currently elected officials.
